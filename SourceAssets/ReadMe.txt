Play Instructions:
Type the full name of the person shown. 
Correct letters are added as you type; wrong letters appear in red to the right of the cursor and make a hangman progress 1 step closer to his gruesome death.  
The name turns green when complete, and their company department is revealed.
Press Enter key to advance to next person. 
Press Right-Arrow to reveal the next letter, but it costs you 3 hangman parts!
Pressing Enter before the name is complete reveals the full name (each revealed letter costs 3 hangman parts).

Goal:
Collect (turn over) all the face cards by typing their names in correctly. If the hangman dies you don't collect the card. But don't fret! The missed card will come around again.  See how quickly and accurately you can collect all the face cards.

Stats Display:
Time			= A timer displays elapsed game time. E.g. 00:44
Collected Counter	= Displays number of cards collected over total cards. E.g. 3/97
Accuracy %		= Displays percentage accuracy (Correctly typed letters divided by total letters typed). E.g. 96%

Special Keys:
Enter Key 	= Reveal full name or Advance to next person (if full name already displayed).
Righ Arrow 	= Hint: Reveals next letter. Costs 3 hangman steps.
Left Arrow	= Erase last letter from name entry. In case you want to back up and retype for practice.
Backspace 	= Effectively nothing, except clear the display of the last wrong letter you typed. 
PageUp 		= Show previous person
PageDown 	= Show next person.

Buttons:
Show All	= Display all cards face up and show name/info of current card.
Case-sensitive	= Toggle between case-sensitive or case-insensitive name-entry. When case-insensitive, wrong case still counts against accuracy, but not for hangman.
Shuffle		= Shuffles the cards and redeals the 1st card (does not restart game).
Restart		= Shuffles the cards and restarts the game.
All Depts	= This is a selector that lets you filter to show a single department (or All Departments).
First & Last	= This is a selector of what name you have to type in to collect the card: First, Last, Department, or First & Last.
Exit		= Quits the app without a confirmation (because this is a deadly game).
