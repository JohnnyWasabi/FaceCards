FaceCards is a flash-card style game for learning people's names.  Written by John Alvarado.

Installation/Running:
--------------------
Copy the whole "FaceCardsGame" folder to your destktop. Open the folder on your desktop and double click the "FaceCards" application. Choose at least 1600x1024 when prompted for resolution. It can be played at lower resolution, but the Yearbook mode currently does not scale to fit and will go off the bottom at lower resolutions.

Play Instructions:
-----------------
Type the full name of the person shown. 
Correct letters are added as you type; wrong letters appear in red to the right of the cursor and make a hangman progress 1 step closer to his gruesome death.  
The name turns green when complete.
Press Enter key to advance to next person. 
Press Right-Arrow to reveal the next letter, but it costs you 3 hangman parts!
Pressing Enter before the name is complete reveals the full name (each revealed letter costs 3 hangman parts).

Goal:
----
Collect (turn over) all the face cards by typing their names in correctly. If the hangman dies you don't collect the card. But don't fret! The missed card will come around again.  See how quickly and accurately you can collect all the face cards to achieve the highest score.

Stats Display:
-------------
Time				= A timer displays elapsed game time. E.g. 00:44
Collected Counter	= Displays number of cards collected over total cards. E.g. 3/97
Accuracy %			= Displays percentage accuracy (Correctly typed letters divided by total letters typed). E.g. 96%
Score				= At the end of a full game (All Depts. and First & Last names) you get a score result from an formulat that incorporates the total characters in all the names, completion time, and percent accuracy.

Special Keys:
------------
Enter Key 	= Reveal full name or Advance to next person (if full name already displayed).
Righ Arrow 	= Hint: Reveals next letter. Costs 3 hangman steps.
Left Arrow	= Erase last letter from name entry. In case you want to back up and retype for practice.
Backspace 	= Effectively nothing, except clear the display of the last wrong letter you typed. 
PageUp 		= Show previous person
PageDown 	= Show next person.

Buttons:
--------
Case-sensitive	= Toggle between case-sensitive or case-insensitive name-entry. When case-insensitive, wrong case still counts against accuracy, but not for hangman.
Typing Game	= This is a selector that lets you choose different modes of the app:
			Typing Game: The typing game described above where you type in the name when shown a face.
			Flash Cards: All faces are shown without names. Click on a face to enlarge it and see their name info.
			Yearbook:    All faces are shown with their names and department below their picture.	
All Depts	= This is a selector that lets you filter to show a single department (or All Departments).
First & Last	= This is a selector of what name you have to enter to collect the card in the Typing Game: First, Last, Department, or First & Last. Only active when in Typing Game mode.
Shuffle		= Shuffles the cards and redeals the 1st card (does not restart game).
Restart		= Shuffles the cards and restarts the game.
Exit		= Quits the app without a confirmation (because this is a deadly game).
Cards/Faces	= Click on any card to display it front & center.  Click on the front & center card to send it back to the grid.
Background	= Right-click with mouse on background to access color-picker dialog for changing the background color. Color is saved in player prefs.

Note: Play at minimum of 1024x768 resolution.  For Yearbook display at least 1600x1024. However, in windowed mood you can resize the window as needed during the game.
