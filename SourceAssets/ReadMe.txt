Play Instructions:
Type the full name of the person shown. 
Correct letters are added as you type; wrong letters appear in red to the right of the cursor and make a hangman progress 1 step closer to his gruesome death.  
The name turns green when complete, and their company department is revealed.
Press Enter key to advance to next person. 
Press Right-Arrow to reveal the next letter, but it costs you 3 hangman parts!
Pressing Enter before the name is complete reveals the full name (each revealed letter costs 3 hangman parts).

Goal:
Collect (turn over) all the face cards by typing their names in correctly. If the hangman dies you don't collect the card. But don't fret! The missed card will come around again.  See how quickly and accurately you can collect all the face cards.

Stats Display:
Time			= A timer displays elapsed game time. E.g. 00:44
Collected Counter	= Displays number of cards collected over total cards. E.g. 3/97

Special Keys:
